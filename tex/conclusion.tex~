\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:concl}
We have described a methodology for the optimisation of dataflow networks, according to patterns often
found in computer vision systems. This methodology and
associated techniques will be of use for computer vision
algorithm designers who must optimise their implementations
to meet some metric budget and for compiler designers in identifying optimisation bottlenecks and possible solutions.
\par Our refactoring methodology, applying transformations to a complex algorithm, resulted in 31\% power consumption reduction and a reduction of 10.36, 31 and 6.4 percentage points in LUTs, BRAMs and DSPs resources usage, respectively.
